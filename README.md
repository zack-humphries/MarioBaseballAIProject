# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a means for others to make their own pitching, batting, fielding, and baserunning AIs for Mario Superstar Baseball. 


# Recreating Physics Engine and Reading/Writing Memory Addresses
So far I've been able to pull and write data into Dolphin (a GameCube emulator) and recreate the physics engine for basic pitches.

### Example
Here is an example where the code reads the mound position (X) of Mario and Baby Luigi's baseball bat at the point of potential contact (Z) 
and then calculates the trajectory of a curve pitch with 10 input frames to the right and 20 input frames to the left

I will be attempting to create my own pitching AI as well as an example.
